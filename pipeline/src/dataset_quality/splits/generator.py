      assumed — the assignment is computed twice and compared before
      returning, and the result is reported in ``reproducibility_check``.
    - Grouped: image ids linked by ``duplicate_pairs`` (near-duplicates, e.g.
      DQ-05's pHash output, once available) are always kept together in a
      single split, so cross-split leakage is impossible by construction.

      just by overall image count — so a minority class's own split
      proportions track the configured ratios too, the same as the totals do.

    A group is only moved out of val or test — to satisfy the *other* one's
    coverage — when that's *safe*: every category the group carries must
    still be covered by some other group left behind in its current split.
    Moving a group out of train is always allowed, since only val/test carry
    a coverage guarantee.

    This is the fix for the review finding that the previous version could
    move a group (in particular a multilabel one, carrying more than one
    category) from val to test, or vice versa, to satisfy one missing class,
    silently dropping a *different* class that split already had covered —
    see the "Mau's review" tests in tests/test_splits.py. When a category
    only has one eligible group in the whole dataset and val and test both
    need it, only one of them can have it (a group can't be split across
    splits) — that's a genuine data-scarcity limit, not a bug, and this
    function leaves the already-covered split alone rather than shuffling
    the gap around.

    Runs to a fixed point (bounded by category count) instead of a single
    val-then-test pass, so a fill made while completing one split's coverage
    is re-checked against the other, not just assumed to stick.
